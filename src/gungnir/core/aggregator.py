"""Consensus signal aggregation: many strategy stances → one decision per symbol.

Why this exists: 26 level-based strategies emitting independently makes the net
position flip-flop as individual strategies cross their thresholds — decision
churn. This module collapses their stances into a single smoothed consensus per
symbol and applies three churn-killers, in order of impact:

  1. **Conflict veto** — if the opposing side carries ≥ ``veto_opposing`` of the
     total vote weight (default 35%), no NEW position is opened. Disagreement is
     exactly where whipsaw is worst; refusing to trade there is cheaper than
     being on the wrong side of half your own book.
  2. **EMA smoothing** — the signed consensus is exponentially smoothed, so a
     single strategy joining/leaving a small stance book cannot swing the
     decision in one bar. Secondary to hysteresis: stances already carry
     persistence (level semantics), so the default alpha is mild (0.6).
  3. **Hysteresis** — enter only when the smoothed consensus clears
     ``enter_threshold``; exit only when it falls below the *lower*
     ``exit_threshold`` or flips sign. Between the two bands: hold, emit
     nothing. ``min_hold_bars`` additionally blocks consensus-driven exits right
     after entry (bracket stops still protect downside).
  4. **Family capping** — the 26 strategies are not independent voters: six
     HMA-Donchian clones agreeing is closer to ONE signal than six. Each stance
     carries a family tag, and no family may contribute more than
     ``family_cap`` of the total vote weight; excess is scaled down before the
     tally. Agreement across *different* signal types is what moves the
     consensus — and a structural dissenter (mean-reverters in a trend) can
     neither be drowned out below the veto threshold by sheer clone count, nor
     dominate it.

Votes are **stances, not edges**: a strategy that emitted BUY keeps voting BUY
until it releases the condition (or flips). Each stance's weight folds in
everything the system knows about signal quality — LLM-blended conviction ×
allocator regime-edge × RL P(take) — so the learners shape the vote *softly*
instead of hard-gating individual signals.

Pure and deterministic: no I/O, no clocks. The Agent owns when ``decide`` is
called (once per fresh-bar pass) and what it does with the result.
