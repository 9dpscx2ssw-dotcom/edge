"""Virtual per-strategy books with netted account execution.

Without netting, every strategy holds its own real position: five strategies
buying US500 in the same loop open five broker deals at the same price (5×
spread, 5× exposure to one idea), and a simultaneous buy+sell pair pays the
spread twice to hold net-zero risk. NettingBroker splits those two concerns:

  • **Virtual books** — every strategy order fills instantly on an internal
    per-(symbol, strategy) paper ledger, at the mark, with the configured cost
    model, brackets and MFE/MAE tracking. These round-trips are what the agent
    journals, the allocator weighs, and the RL policy learns from — attribution
    is exactly as if each strategy traded alone.
  • **Net account** — the wrapped account broker (PaperBroker in dry-run,
    Capital.com live) holds at most ONE position per symbol, tagged
    ``__net__``: the signed sum of the virtual books. ``reconcile(symbol)``
    (called by the agent once per symbol per fast loop) brings the account to
    that target with at most one close + one open.

Consequences worth knowing:
  • Net positions carry NO broker-side stop/take-profit — per-strategy brackets
    are meaningless on a netted book. Exits are agent-managed on the virtual
    books (`_manage_exits`), and the resulting net change flows to the account
    on the next reconcile. Set ``execution.netting: false`` to restore
    one-deal-per-strategy execution with broker-side brackets.
  • Account equity is the netted book's truth; the journal measures strategy
    skill from virtual fills. They can legitimately differ by the spread the
    netting saved.
  • Account positions NOT tagged ``__net__`` (adopted/manual deals) are left
    alone by reconciliation and still surfaced via ``open_positions`` so
    exposure counting and operator alerts see them.
