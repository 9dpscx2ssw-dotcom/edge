"""Transaction-cost model for backtests and paper fills.

Mid-price candles overstate performance: in reality you cross the bid/ask spread
on entry *and* exit, pay commission on notional, and eat slippage on top. Filling
both sides at the candle close (mid) makes every strategy look better than it is —
catastrophically so for high-frequency ones (scalp/FVG/M1) where the round-trip
cost can exceed the per-trade edge. This applies all three so backtest and shadow
numbers reflect tradeable performance.

Everything is in basis points (1 bp = 0.01%) of price/notional, so the model is
instrument-scale invariant (works for EURUSD at 1.1 and US30 at 40,000 alike).
